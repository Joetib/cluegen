# Installation

If you've found your way here, you're probably wondering where's the
`setup.py` file?  How do I install `cluegen`?

In short, you don't install it.  `cluegen` is free software that you
can take, modify, and use in your own projects.  You do that by
copying the code into your project. There is only one file
`cluegen.py`.  It is under 100 lines of code. It has no external
dependencies. If it works, you keep it in your project. You own it.
